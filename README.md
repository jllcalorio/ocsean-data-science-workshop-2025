# OCSEAN Data Science Workshop 2025

This houses the Python pipeline for the Bristol Computational Linguistics and Data Science Workshop held on May-June 2025 in Bristol, UK. 

The participants to this workshop were from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Participants were chosen based on their prior valuable involvement in local research in their respective countries, to which the Oceanic and Southeast Asian Navigators (OCSEAN) netwrok has deeply appreciated and recognized. 

OCSEAN is funded by the European Commission with a H2020-MSCA-RISE-2019 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange grant, Project Number 873207.Â OCSEAN was launched in January 2020 and will operate till the end of 2025. Led by a consortium of nine European universities including the University of Tartu, the project is a collaboration with various universities and institutes in Island Southeast Asia and Oceania. It unites researchers from across the world to re-evaluate our understanding of the Austronesian expansion, doing so by using new high-density data from archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistics and genomics within a common statistical framework. For more information see www.ocsean.eu website.

Participants were being supervised by Daniel Lawson, PhD. An OCSEAN Steering Group Member and Director of the Jean Golding Institute for Data Science and Data Intensive Research, University of Bristol.
