  ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add new notebook for exploratory data analysis"
  ```
6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
  ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Head over to the original `ocsean-data-science-workshop-2025` repository on GitHub and open a new pull request from your branch.
